# Source index

Checked 2026-07-15. Prefer stable or versioned pages for implementation. `latest` pages are discovery aids and must be rechecked when a command, default, supported target, or security behavior matters.

## Coverage matrix

| Requested dimension | Primary evidence group | Skill reference | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Board, SoC, memory, USB, and port identification | ESP-IDF, esptool, development-board docs, family datasheets | `decisions-and-preflight.md` | Covered; exact board artifacts remain task inputs. |
| Electrical limits, strapping, pins, and power | Family datasheets and hardware design guidelines | `hardware-and-electrical-safety.md` | Covered by procedure; no universal pin table is asserted. |
| ESP-IDF C/C++ | ESP-IDF Programming Guide | `firmware-frameworks.md`, `native-tool-workflows.md` | Covered. |
| Arduino and PlatformIO | Arduino-ESP32 and PlatformIO official docs | `firmware-frameworks.md`, `native-tool-workflows.md` | Covered. |
| MicroPython and CircuitPython | Project docs, downloads, and ESP32 quick start | `firmware-frameworks.md`, `native-tool-workflows.md` | Covered with board-support boundaries. |

| Rust on ESP | Official Rust on ESP book, `esp-generate`, and `espflash` | `firmware-frameworks.md`, `native-tool-workflows.md` | Covered; support must be refreshed by chip/toolchain. |
| NuttX and additional firmware | Apache NuttX family pages | `firmware-frameworks.md` | Covered as an intentional secondary path, not the default. |
| GPIO, ADC/DAC, PWM, touch, buses, timers, USB/JTAG | ESP-IDF peripheral catalog plus framework APIs | `peripherals-and-buses.md` | Covered by capability and diagnostic workflow. |
| Sensors, displays, and actuators | Manufacturer datasheets, module schematics, maintained drivers | `sensors-actuators-and-calibration.md` | Covered by reusable component contract; individual parts are task inputs. |
| Wi-Fi, BLE, other radios, sleep, storage, and OTA | ESP-IDF and framework update/network docs | `connectivity-power-and-ota.md` | Covered with family-support checks. |
| Flashing, logs, crashes, recovery, and security | esptool, ESP-IDF monitor/fatal/JTAG/security docs | `debugging-recovery-and-security.md` | Covered, including irreversible-operation boundaries. |
| Validation and physical verification | All framework build/test docs plus hardware boundary checks | `native-tool-workflows.md` | Covered; successful component tests are not promoted to hardware proof. |

## Component sources

For every attached device, prefer:

1. component manufacturer's current datasheet and errata;
2. breakout/module vendor schematic and pinout;
3. framework-maintained component/driver documentation;
4. vendor-maintained driver source and examples;
5. independent tutorials only as clearly labeled practice evidence.

Record URLs, document revisions, access date, exact claims used, and gaps in `templates/component-contract.md`.

## Refresh rules

Recheck sources when changing ESP-IDF major/minor version, Arduino core major version, ESPHome release train, MicroPython/CircuitPython major version, Zephyr release, Rust toolchain/HAL generation, NuttX release, SoC family/revision, bootloader/partition/security state, board revision, or attached component revision. Always recheck irreversible security commands and flash offsets immediately before execution.
