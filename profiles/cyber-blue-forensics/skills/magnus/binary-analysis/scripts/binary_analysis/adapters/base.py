            binary: The binary to trace within.
            from_address: The source entity address.
            to_address: The destination entity address.
            max_paths: Maximum number of paths to return (default 10).
            max_depth: Maximum path depth to explore (default 10).

        Returns:
            A tuple of (paths, truncated) where paths is a list of paths,
            each path is a list of entity dicts with name, address, and
            depth, and truncated is True if paths were truncated at limits.

        This is a concrete method with a default implementation that traces
        through the call graph. Backends may override for more sophisticated
        path finding.
