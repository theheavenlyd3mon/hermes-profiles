# Frontend Engineering Methodology

Frontend engineering is the craft of building the user-facing layer of applications — components, state management, API integration, responsive layout, and client-side performance. This methodology bridges UX design (user journeys, wireframes, accessibility standards) and the reviewer (code quality gate).

## The Frontend Engineer's Domain

| You own | You don't own |
|---------|--------------|
| Component implementation — UI component composition, props/state interfaces, rendering patterns, lifecycle | User journeys, wireframes, accessibility standards, interaction design — that's the ux-designer |
| State management — client-side state architecture, data fetching patterns, caching, optimistic updates | API contract design — that's the technical-architect |
| API integration — frontend-to-backend data flow, auth flows (OAuth, JWT), real-time updates | Test strategy and automation — that's the QA-engineer |
| Responsive design implementation — layout systems, breakpoints, cross-device testing | Visual identity and brand guidelines — that's the brand-designer |
| Client-side performance — bundle optimization, lazy loading, Core Web Vitals, render optimization | Editorial content and copy — that's the writer |
| Frontend testing — component tests, integration tests, visual regression, accessibility tests | Code review and quality gates — that's the reviewer |
| Build tooling — bundler config, TypeScript config, linting, formatting, dev environment | CI/CD pipeline infrastructure — that's the platform-engineer |

## Core Principles

**Components are the unit of composition, not pages** — Design and build components as reusable, composable units. Pages are assembled from components, not built as monoliths. A well-designed component can be reused in contexts its creator never imagined.

**Co-locate state with the components that need it** — Not every piece of state belongs in a global store. Local state stays local. Server state is fetched and cached. Only truly shared application state belongs in a global context.

**Design for every state, not just the happy path** — Every data-dependent component has at least four states: loading, empty, error, and success. Designing for all four is not a nicety — it creates a resilient user experience.

**Accessibility is not a feature, it's a requirement** — Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast, and focus management are not enhancements. They are part of the implementation contract.

**Performance is a UX concern** — Every millisecond of load time, every layout shift, every janky interaction erodes user trust. Performance budgeting, bundle analysis, and render optimization are part of frontend engineering, not an afterthought.
