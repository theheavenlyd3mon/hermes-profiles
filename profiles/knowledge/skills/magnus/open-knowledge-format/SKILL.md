# Open Knowledge Format (OKF) — v0.1

Google Cloud published the [Open Knowledge Format v0.1](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing/) on **June 12, 2026** — an open specification that formalizes the [LLM-wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) into a portable, vendor-neutral format for AI agent knowledge.

**The design is intentionally minimal:** a directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter. No schema registry, no central authority, no required tooling.

> "If you can `cat` a file, you can read OKF; if you can `git clone` a repo, you can ship it."

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Knowledge Bundle** | A self-contained directory tree of markdown files. The unit of distribution. |
| **Concept** | A single unit of knowledge — one markdown file. May describe a table, a metric, a playbook, an API, or any idea. |
| **Concept ID** | The file path with `.md` stripped (e.g. `tables/users.md` has ID `tables/users`). |
| **Frontmatter** | YAML block at the top of each file with structured metadata. |
| **Body** | Standard markdown content after the frontmatter. |
| **Link** | A markdown link from one concept to another — expresses relationships. |

## Reference Files

| Reference | Load when | File |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Spec summary | You need the full OKF v0.1 specification, conformance criteria, and field definitions | `references/spec-summary.md` |
| Bundle architecture | You're creating or structuring an OKF bundle — directory layout, index files, cross-linking conventions | `references/bundle-architecture.md` |
| Use cases | You need real-world examples, third-party implementations, and adoption patterns | `references/use-cases.md` |

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Load when |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `okf-bundle-validate.py` | Validate an OKF bundle directory — checks frontmatter, required fields, reserved filenames, and cross-link integrity | You've created or modified an OKF bundle and want to verify conformance |

## Assets

| Asset | Purpose | Path |
|-------|---------|------|
| Concept template | A template markdown file with all recommended frontmatter fields and body sections | `assets/concept-template.md` |
| Example bundle | A minimal but complete OKF bundle showing directory structure, index files, and cross-linked concepts | `assets/example-bundle/` |

## Bundle Structure

```
path/to/bundle/
├── index.md                      # Optional. Directory listing for progressive disclosure.
├── log.md                        # Optional. Chronological update history.
├── <concept>.md                  # A concept at the bundle root.
└── <subdirectory>/               # Subdirectories organize concepts into groups.
    ├── index.md
    ├── <concept>.md
    └── <subdirectory>/
        └── …
```

Files named `index.md` and `log.md` are **reserved** — they have defined semantics and must not be used for concept documents.

## Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
type: <Type name>                  # REQUIRED
title: <Optional display name>
description: <Optional one-line summary>
resource: <Optional canonical URI for the underlying asset>
tags: [<tag>, <tag>, …]            # Optional
timestamp: <ISO 8601 datetime>     # Optional last-modified time
# … other producer-defined key/value pairs
---
```

**Required:** `type` — a short string identifying the kind of concept. Types are NOT registered centrally. Producers pick descriptive values; consumers tolerate unknown types gracefully.

**Conventional body sections:**

| Heading | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `# Schema` | Structured description of an asset's columns/fields |
| `# Examples` | Concrete usage examples, often as code blocks |
| `# Citations` | External sources backing claims in the body |

## Cross-linking

Concepts link to each other via standard markdown links:

- **Absolute (bundle-relative):** Begin with `/`, relative to bundle root. Recommended — stable when documents move.
- **Relative:** Standard markdown relative paths.

A link from concept A to concept B asserts a relationship. The specific kind (references, depends-on, joins-with) is conveyed by the surrounding prose, not by the link syntax.

**Consumers MUST tolerate broken links** — a link whose target doesn't exist is not malformed; it may represent not-yet-written knowledge.

## Conformance

A bundle is **conformant** with OKF v0.1 if:

1. Every non-reserved `.md` file contains parseable YAML frontmatter
2. Every frontmatter block contains a non-empty `type` field
3. Reserved filenames (`index.md`, `log.md`) follow their defined structure

**Consumers MUST NOT reject a bundle for:** missing optional frontmatter fields, unknown `type` values, unknown frontmatter keys, broken cross-links, or missing `index.md` files.

## Relationship to Other Formats

| Format | How OKF Differs |
|--------|----------------|
| **Karpathy's LLM Wiki** | OKF specifies the interoperability surface — required fields, reserved filenames, conformance criteria |
| **Obsidian / Notion vaults** | OKF is format-only — no tooling, no runtime, no UI. Any editor works |
| **AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md** | OKF is multi-file, hierarchical, cross-linked — not a single convention file |
| **Metadata-as-code repos** | OKF standardizes the file format so different producers and consumers interoperate |
| **Domain schemas (Avro, Protobuf, OpenAPI)** | OKF references them — it does not subsume or replace them |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a bundle directory
mkdir my-knowledge && cd my-knowledge

# 2. Create a concept file
cat > datasets/sales.md << 'EOF'
---
type: BigQuery Dataset
title: Sales
description: All sales-related tables for the retail business.
tags: [sales]
timestamp: 2026-06-18T00:00:00Z
---
The sales dataset contains [orders](/tables/orders.md) and [customers](/tables/customers.md).
EOF

# 3. Add an index for navigation
cat > index.md << 'EOF'
# Knowledge Bundle

* Sales Dataset (`datasets/sales.md`) - Retail sales data in an example OKF bundle
EOF

# 4. Validate your bundle
python3 scripts/okf-bundle-validate.py .
```

## Gotchas

- **Type values are not registered centrally.** Pick descriptive types (`BigQuery Table`, `Playbook`, `Metric`). Consumers should handle unknown types gracefully.
- **File path is the identity.** Renaming a file changes its concept ID. Use stable paths or add redirects in documentation.
- **`index.md` uses no frontmatter** (except optionally at the bundle root for `okf_version`). The body is a markdown list with links.
- **`log.md` date headings must be ISO 8601** (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Cross-links are untyped.** The relationship semantics live in the prose, not in the link syntax. Graph builders treat all links as directed edges.
- **OKF does not specify a tag-browsing format.** Producers that want tag aggregation should synthesize it at consumption time by scanning frontmatter.
- **OKF v0.1 is a draft.** The spec will evolve. Minor bumps add backward-compatible features; major bumps may break required fields. Consumers should do best-effort consumption on unknown versions.
