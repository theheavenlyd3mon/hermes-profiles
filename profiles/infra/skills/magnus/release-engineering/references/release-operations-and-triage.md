# Release Operations and Triage

How large projects actually run releases: the ceremony mechanics of four well-documented release trains (Chromium, Firefox, GitLab, Ubuntu), the shared patterns behind them, coordination roles, pipeline debugging, release-infrastructure reliability, environment parity, and the state of AI/agent-assisted release automation in 2025–2026.

## Release Train Ceremony Mechanics

### Chromium: 4-Week Milestones with Weekly Security Refreshes

Chrome ships a new milestone to stable **every 4 weeks**: 4 weeks of development on `main` (starting at the previous milestone's branch point), a **branch cut**, then 4 weeks of stabilization on the milestone branch, then staged rollout to stable. Key mechanics:

- **Channels:** Canary (daily, most unstable) → Dev → Beta → Stable, plus **Extended Stable** — every *other* milestone maintained for 4 extra weeks with backported security fixes (8-week cadence, Windows/Mac enterprise only, biweekly refreshes).
- **Weekly stable "refreshes"** carry security fixes forward to keep the *patch gap* short.
- **Staged rollout:** a release generally reaches all users within 1–2 weeks unless major issues arise; staged rollouts compare two identical builds that differ only in build number for statistical signal.
- **Cycle checkpoints:** **Branch Point** (features must be code-complete, strings landed, beta blockers addressed; incomplete features are punted) → **Beta Promotion** (4 weeks in beta with weekly builds) → **Early Stable Cut** (early release candidate to a small % of stable users; all stable blockers fixed) → **Stable Cut/Promotion** → weekly **Stable Refresh**.
- **Dates flex for coverage:** branch-point dates are fixed but adjusted to avoid shipping around major holidays so coverage is maintained.
- **Merge (cherry-pick) governance:** all code lands on trunk; every merge to a release branch is gated because it "introduces risk and costs time." **Release managers (and security delegates) review all merges**, with criteria that tighten as the stable date approaches: beta phase (Finch-gated fixes, new regressions, release blockers, security issues, emergency string changes) → stable phase (urgent regressions, release blockers, medium+ security) → extended phase (medium+ security only). Automation (Blintz) does first-pass triage and may auto-approve; release managers answer within 2 business days; missed merges of release-blocking fixes are flagged.

### Firefox: 2-Week Trains with Flag-Driven Uplifts

- **Cadence:** the standard release interval is **two weeks** (may be lengthened around holidays). Nightly builds flow from `firefox-main` roughly every 12 hours; **every 2 weeks, main merges to `firefox-beta`**, after which the beta branch takes stabilization patches only.
- **Beta releases** ship ~3x/week for Desktop → about **5 betas per cycle**, unless emergency "chemspills" (unplanned betas) are needed. At cycle end, the **final build is QA-validated and tagged** into `firefox-release`.
- **Channels/repos:** `firefox-main` (Nightly), `firefox-beta` (+ Devedition), `firefox-release`, `firefox-esr` (ESR for enterprises).
- **Uplift process is flag-driven:** a developer sets `tracking-firefoxXX: ?` to nominate; Release Management sets `tracking-firefoxXX: +` if it should block the release; the patch is nominated with `approval-mozilla-beta/release: ?`; on `+`, **sheriffs or release managers land it** on the branch and ensure Treeherder is green. `relnote-firefox` nominates release-note changes; "nag emails" chase owners of tracked blockers.
- **Merge day:** at the end of the beta cycle, release management emails release-drivers requesting the main→release merge; anything needing uplift must be nominated before the RC build. Security bugs follow a separate security-approval process.
- **Mobile:** Android RC builds push to production at **5% rollout after QA signoff**, bumped to 25% on the official release date to match Desktop.

### GitLab: Monthly Self-Managed Releases Off Continuous Delivery

- **Two-part model:** a **monthly self-managed release** (`XX.YY.0`) plus **continuous delivery on GitLab.com**, where auto-deploy packages built from `master` deploy multiple times per day.
- **Release day:** the self-managed release ships on the **third Thursday** of each month (with a one-week delay if needed); patches land twice a month (scheduled) plus unplanned critical patches as needed; the stated priority of both processes is "GitLab availability & security."
- **Flow:** engineer merge → pipeline packages an **auto-deploy package** (multiple/day) → deployed to GitLab.com if no Production Change Locks or unhealthy environments → changes that succeed on GitLab.com become the **release candidate** for self-managed → RC runs automated QA in test environments → RC tagged and published. **All changes must deploy to GitLab.com before they are considered for a self-managed release** — dogfooding is the gate.
- **Patch ceremony:** e.g., an Early Merge Phase on Mondays where release managers deploy security fixes to GitLab.com; MRs labeled `~"security-target"` link to the security tracking issue.

### Ubuntu: 6-Month Cycle with a Graduated Freeze Ladder

- **Cadence:** strict time-based release every **6 months** (since 2004), LTS every ~2 years. The freeze ladder is a sequence of progressively tighter gates, with exceptions granted only by the Release Team:
  1. **Debian Import Freeze** — automatic imports from Debian `unstable` stop; imports must be explicitly requested.
  2. **Feature Freeze** — no new features, packages, or API/ABI changes; bug-fix-only uploads allowed if documented.
  3. **UI Freeze** — default-app UI, artwork, and user-visible strings frozen (for docs/translation).
  4. **Documentation String Freeze** and **Kernel Feature Freeze** — docs frozen for translation; kernel feature-complete.
  5. **Hardware Enablement Freeze** → **Beta Freeze** — all uploads queued and subject to manual Release Team approval; after beta ships, the archive rolls back to Feature + UI freeze status.
  6. **Kernel Freeze** → translation deadlines → **Final Freeze** — "extremely high-caution": only release-critical, security-critical, or exceptional fixes, confirmed by the Release Team; near release, uploads go to the `-proposed` pocket and the Release Team cherry-picks into `-release`.
  7. **Release Candidate** — images built Monday of release week; ideally RC == final release.
- **Post-release:** the **SRU (Stable Release Update)** process governs fixes; each upload must reference at least one bug.

### Shared Mechanics Across All Four

| Lever | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| **Cadence choice** | Time-based (fixed calendar) beats feature-based: Chromium 4w, Firefox 2w, GitLab monthly, Ubuntu 6m. Dates fixed; **scope flexes** |
| **Branch cut** | A cut from the development line creates a stabilization branch (Chromium milestone branch, Firefox `firefox-beta`, GitLab RC tag, Ubuntu archive freezes). New features stop at the cut |
| **Stabilization window** | Dedicated period where only bug-fix/stabilization patches land, gated by criteria that tighten over time (Chromium beta→stable→extended; Ubuntu graduated freezes; Firefox beta uplift rules) |
| **Backport approval** | Formal nomination + approval gate with **named approvers** (Chromium release managers + Blintz automation; Firefox tracking/approval flags + sheriffs; Ubuntu Release Team exceptions; GitLab `security-target` label + release managers). Criteria escalate with risk and branch age |
| **Readiness / go-no-go** | Staged rollout with explicit signoffs (Chromium Stable Cut, Firefox QA on RC, Ubuntu Final Freeze + RC, GitLab automated QA + Production Change Locks) |
| **Staged rollout** | Ship to a fraction first, monitor, expand (Chromium staged %, Firefox Android 5%→25%, GitLab.com before self-managed) |
| **Coverage awareness** | Dates adjusted for holidays and staffing coverage (Chromium explicit; Firefox "lengthened for holidays") |

## Coordination Roles and Ceremonies

- **Release Manager (RM) / DRI:** the operational single-threaded owner. GitLab runs RMs on a **rotation/schedule** with explicit escalation paths and public permissions; Chromium release managers review/approve/reject every branch merge within 2 business days; Firefox Release Management sets tracking flags and lands approved uplifts via sheriffs.
- **Sheriffs / release drivers:** Firefox sheriffs land approved patches and keep Treeherder green; a `release-drivers` channel and mailing lists coordinate across teams.
- **Delegates:** the security team acts as a merge-approval delegate for security fixes (Chromium).
- **Ceremonies:** milestone kickoff/planning → recurring status (GitLab's **weekly delivery-metrics review** — MTTP, deployment blockers, Deployment SLO, DORA metrics, auto-deploy dashboards; Firefox channel meetings and nag emails) → branch cut → stabilization with readiness tracking → **go/no-go** (cut/RC signoff) → staged promotion → refresh/patch cadence.
- **Communication surfaces:** Slack/Matrix channels (`#releases`, `#release-drivers`), dashboards (Chromium Dash, GitLab Grafana + DORA analytics, Firefox release calendar), and issue-tracker queries for blockers.

The recurring roles across all four projects:

| Role | What they do | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Release Manager (RM) / DRI** | Single-threaded owner of a given release; approves backports, drives go/no-go, owns escalation | GitLab rotating RMs; Chromium RMs approving every branch merge; Firefox Release Management |
| **Sheriff / release driver** | Lands approved patches, keeps the tree green, chases blockers | Firefox sheriffs; Chromium build sheriffs |
| **Security delegate** | Approves/lands security fixes on release branches under a faster path | Chromium security team as merge delegates |
| **QA sign-off** | Validates the RC before promotion | Firefox final-build QA; GitLab automated QA on RC |
| **Automation (first-pass triage)** | Screens merge requests against criteria, flags missed merges | Chromium Blintz (formerly Sheriffbot) |

**Ceremony lifecycle (the recurring rhythm):** kickoff/milestone planning → recurring status (metrics review, channel meetings) → **branch cut** (feature-complete gate) → stabilization with readiness tracking → **go/no-go** (cut/RC signoff) → staged promotion → refresh/patch cadence → next cycle kickoff.

## Debugging Release Pipelines

### Failure Taxonomy

| Failure mode | Symptom | First response |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| **Flaky tests** | Intermittent pass/fail unrelated to the change — the #1 time sink | Quarantine, retry-with-backoff, root-cause (timing, shared state, resource contention) |
| **Cache poisoning / stale cache** | Corrupt or stale build/dependency cache produces failures or wrong artifacts | Invalidate and rebuild; pin cache keys |
| **Version / dependency drift** | Unpinned deps or toolchains resolve differently across runs ("works on my machine") | Pin versions; enforce lockfiles |
| **Secret rotation** | Expired/rotated tokens cause auth failures mid-pipeline | Scoped tokens, rotation runbooks, secret lifecycle management |
| **Runner exhaustion** | Saturated runner pool, pod timeouts, resource contention | Capacity planning, queue observability, autoscaling |
| **Registry/rate limits** | Docker Hub/registry pull limits, API timeouts | Proxy/mirror registries, retry policy, quota monitoring |
| **Environment mismatch / permissions** | Env vars, file permissions, OS differences between runner and prod | Enforce parity (see below); CI matrix vs. prod |

### Change-vs-Pipeline Triage

The core question for any pipeline failure: **is it the change or the pipeline?** Workflow:

1. **Reproduce/replay** the run; compare against a known-green baseline run.
2. **Read logs first** — find the *first* failure (earliest `level=error`), trace backward via correlation IDs / job IDs.
3. **Bisect** — `git bisect` for code; re-run individual jobs/stages to isolate the failing step.
4. **Correlate across systems** — match CI logs → container logs → deploy logs with shared correlation IDs.
5. **Classify transient vs. systemic** — roughly 60% of CI failures are transient (timeouts, rate limits, network, resource contention) → retry-with-backoff and record the rationale; systemic → fix.
6. **Watch intermittent signals** — warnings/retries/degraded performance preceding a failure often point to environment/config issues.
7. **Check external dependencies** — third-party API and cloud timeouts.

**Rerun vs. fix:** rerun only when the failure is transient/flaky and isolated; fix when systemic, reproducible, or tied to the change. Never blind-rerun — classify with observability first. The observability substrate: structured JSON logs (`timestamp/level/service/message/correlation_id`) shipped to Loki/Promtail or ELK; Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards; OpenTelemetry traces; and exemplars that jump from a metrics spike straight to the relevant log lines. Retention and rotation (logrotate, Loki retention, ES ILM) are part of the design, not an afterthought — you will need history when a release incident surfaces days later.

### Deploy-Time Failure Recovery

When a deployment fails in production, the recovery options in rough preference order:

1. **Revert / roll back** — simplest, *when a viable rollback target exists*. Disable the feature flag, remove the new version from the load-balancer pool, restore the previous artifact. "Wherever possible, reverting a change causing a customer incident should be the initial plan of attack."
2. **Failover to secondary/DR environment** — when there is no change in play (external cause) or rollback is onerous: promote the DB leader, reroute traffic.
3. **Fix forward** — last resort: customers stay impacted until you diagnose, remediate, and redeploy.

**Why rollback fails (and what to design around):** protocol changes clients cannot revert from; destructive DB schema changes; components that do not blue-green well (databases, message brokers). Identify non-rollback-able areas *in advance* and redesign them; keep the previous version retained until the next deploy so a half-complete rollout can be reverted. **Timebox fix-forward attempts** (e.g., 30 minutes) then roll back; document the decision path in runbooks so tribal knowledge becomes institutional steps.

**The emergency release path** deserves the same rigor as the normal path, not less: model a hotfix as a near-identical production pipeline that fetches the artifact earlier (skipping full promotion), kept paused with strict trigger controls and break-glass approvals. If your pipeline is fast enough, prefer committing the fix through the *whole* pipeline so it is fully tested — then do RCA on how the bad build reached production in the first place. The "shortcut" should be the exception with a post-implementation review attached, never the routine.

## Release Infrastructure Reliability and DR

The release toolchain — CI servers, artifact storage, registries, deploy tooling — **is critical infrastructure**. Treat it that way:

- **Artifact storage:** a checksum-deduplicated store (e.g., Artifactory's SHA1 filestore + metadata DB) requires backing up **both** the filestore and the metadata DB, or the filestore is "just a folder with files named after their checksum" — unidentifiable. Snapshot the DB *before* copying the filestore to avoid dangling references; use federated/replicated second sites and restore drills.
- **Signing keys and master keys are the crown jewels:** loss of the master key means loss of all encrypted secrets/passwords at recovery time; treat key escrow, rotation, and a recovery runbook as a top DR item. Same logic applies to artifact signing keys — losing them bricks future releases and undermines supply-chain trust.
- **Runner fleet:** capacity planning, autoscaling, multi-region, queue observability; treat runners as cattle.
- **DR fundamentals:** multi-region deployment, automated failover, IaC for reproducible recovery, defined RTO/RPO, and *tested* failover. DR is also the enabler for safe maintenance windows.

**Disaster scenarios and mitigations:**

| Scenario | Mitigation |
|----------|-----------|
| Registry/artifact corruption | Checksum-based dedup + federated/replicated second site + regular restore drills |
| Signing/master-key loss | Key escrow and backup; loss of the master key means loss of all encrypted secrets at recovery; rotation + recovery runbook |
| Build-cache loss | Cache is regenerable but expensive: pin cache keys, keep warm caches in multiple regions, budget cold-rebuild capacity |
| CI server / runner fleet outage | Fleet capacity planning, autoscaling, multi-region, queue observability; treat runners as cattle |
| Compliance/tamper challenge | Immutable/WORM artifact storage for tamper evidence and retention |
| Maintenance windows | Active-passive DR enables taking the registry/CI down for hardware maintenance safely |

## Config Drift and Environment Parity

Despite decades of best practices, teams still hit the **"repro gap"**: features work locally but break in staging/prod because environments are maintained separately and drift in service versions, configurations, and environment variables. Key failure drivers: the shared "staging queue" (manual hotfixes applied to staging that never flow back), **Docker being insufficient** (Compose handles local service relationships but not cloud routing/lifecycle), and **stale or stubbed data** — the leading cause of late-stage deployment failures.

Mitigations: generate every environment (local, preview, prod) from **one declarative, version-controlled manifest** so drift is structurally impossible; branch the whole environment on git branch; use byte-for-byte production clones into isolated preview environments with automated sanitization; manage secrets with scoped tokens and runtime injection (never store real secrets in non-prod configs); audit rollback data for environment-diff-caused failures; tear ephemeral preview environments down after merge.

## AI/Agent-Assisted Release Automation (2025–2026)

The CI/CD layer is where agentic adoption lags most: AI adoption among individual developers crossed 90% by early 2026, but only ~13% of organizations have AI across the full delivery lifecycle. The emerging paradigm is **CA/CD (Continuous Agentic/Continuous Deployment)**: agents observe pipeline state, reason about whether failures are transient vs. systemic and whether a deploy window is safe, act autonomously on low-risk decisions, and escalate high-risk ones — "risk-aware releases rather than pass/fail gates."

**What exists today:**

- **GitHub Agentic Workflows** (technical preview, 2026): automation written in plain Markdown instead of YAML, compiled to standard Actions running coding agents; handles issue triage, PR review, CI failure root-cause analysis, and repo maintenance. Security-first: read-only by default, sandboxed, network-isolated, SHA-pinned dependencies, sanitized writes. GitHub's **Copilot Coding Agent** opens PRs, and **CI checks do not run on agent-authored PRs until a human approves**.
- **MCP as the integration standard:** CircleCI ships a production MCP server exposing pipeline graphs, build history, and failure logs to agents; Dagger agents monitor pipelines, generate patches, and submit them **through the same review process as human code** with a "rationale diff"; Nx offers AI self-healing CI (analyze → propose fix → apply → re-run affected checks, with a decision trace).
- **Self-healing** is the most mature capability: failure classification (high reported F1 on flaky tests, runner pod timeouts, dependency install failures), transient-vs-systemic routing (~60% transient → auto retry), policy-gated fix generation, and outcome learning.

**Governance: tiered autonomy** is the dominant architecture — match agent authority to action risk:

| Tier | Actions | Authority |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Low** | Retry transient failures, update docs, reorder tests | Fully autonomous |
| **Medium** | Revert a failing deploy, scale ahead of predicted load | Autonomous + logging + notify |
| **High** | Merge to main, modify security policy, infra changes | Human approval required |
| **Critical** | Architectural changes, prod data migrations | Formal review gate |

Companion controls: **immutable audit trails** (what/when/why/what-changed, for debugging and compliance), **policy-as-code** validation of agent decisions (quotas, security, blast radius), **confidence-gated autonomy** (low-confidence/high-impact → human), and **human checkpoints at high-blast-radius transitions** (merge to release branch, deploy to prod, access-control changes).

> **Gotcha — agents amplify whatever exists:** "High-velocity, high-confidence mistakes." Fragile pipelines get broken faster; thin test coverage ships untested code at higher velocity. The teams advancing fastest defined their autonomy tiers clearly, built observable audit trails, and expanded agent authority only as confidence grew. **Trust calibration, not tooling, is the bottleneck** — and governance must be built in from the start, not retrofitted after agents run autonomously. Vendor-reported numbers (e.g., ~94% automatic failure resolution, ROI figures) should be attributed, not treated as independently validated.

**Implication for release engineers:** the job shifts from *executing* releases to *defining autonomy tiers, reviewing agent rationale diffs, owning audit trails, and calibrating trust*. Routine toil (retrying flakes, triaging failures, drafting changelogs, dependency updates) is delegated; humans concentrate on go/no-go judgment, security, and high-blast-radius approvals. The human gate is deliberately preserved.

## Running a Release Train: The Operational Checklist

Synthesis of the four projects' mechanics into a reusable operating rhythm for any train-based release:

1. **Publish the calendar first.** Fixed dates for branch cut, RC, and stable; adjust for holidays/coverage; communicate in a shared channel.
2. **Set the feature-complete gate at the branch cut.** Code-complete, strings landed, blockers addressed; anything incomplete is punted, not carried.
3. **Publish merge criteria that tighten over time.** Permissive early (beta phase), restrictive as stable approaches; named approvers with an SLA; automation for first-pass triage.
4. **Run a dedicated stabilization window.** Only bug-fix/stabilization patches land; track readiness on a shared dashboard.
5. **Gate promotion with explicit signoffs.** RC validated by QA, staged rollout to a small cohort, monitor, expand.
6. **Keep a refresh/patch cadence** (weekly security refreshes, scheduled patches) so fixes don't wait for the next milestone.
7. **Review delivery metrics weekly** (deployment frequency, lead time, blockers) and use the review to improve tooling and process, not to blame.

## Gotchas

- **Cadence values move:** Chromium moved from 6-week to 4-week milestones; Firefox from 4-week to 2-week releases. Teach cadence as a *design choice* (fixed calendar, flexible scope) and cite current values as examples, not doctrine.
- **A branch cut is a feature-complete gate, not a suggestion:** every project above that enforces it (Chromium punts incomplete features; Ubuntu freezes; Firefox stops features at beta).
- **Merge criteria must tighten over time:** permissive early, restrictive as the stable date approaches — the opposite order is how regressions ship.
- **Never treat your registry/CI as disposable:** they are critical infrastructure with backup, DR, and key-escrow requirements; see [toolchain-landscape.md](./toolchain-landscape.md) and [metrics-and-dora.md](./metrics-and-dora.md) for adjacent operational context.
