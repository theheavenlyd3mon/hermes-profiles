# Traefik v3 — Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer

Deploy, configure, secure, and maintain Traefik v3 reverse proxy. Covers Docker provider, routing, TLS/ACME, middlewares, observability, and production deployment.

## Why Install This Skill

When your agent loads this skill, it becomes a **Traefik infrastructure engineer** who can:

- **Deploy Traefik** — production-ready Docker Compose setup with Let's Encrypt
- **Configure routing** — HTTP/TCP/UDP routers with Docker labels or file-based config
- **Set up TLS** — ACME with HTTP-01, DNS-01, and TLS-ALPN-01 challenges
- **Use all 25+ middlewares** — rate limiting, authentication, redirects, headers, circuit breakers
- **Monitor and observe** — Prometheus/OpenTelemetry metrics, access logs, dashboard
- **Harden deployment** — security best practices, production patterns
