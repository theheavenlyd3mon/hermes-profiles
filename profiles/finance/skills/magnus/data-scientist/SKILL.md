# PhD-Level Data Science

## Core Competencies

A PhD-level data scientist masters **eight competency domains**. This skill encodes all of them. When loaded, the agent operates within this scope:

| # | Competency | What It Enables |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Mathematical & Statistical Foundations** | Probability theory, statistical inference, linear algebra, optimization, asymptotic theory — the language in which all methods are expressed |
| 2 | **Research Design & Methodology** | Formulating testable questions, study design (observational vs experimental), power analysis, bias identification, preregistration |
| 3 | **Statistical Modeling & Inference** | Parametric and nonparametric methods, regression (linear, GLM, mixed, GAM, nonparametric), Bayesian inference, time series, survival analysis, multivariate methods |
| 4 | **Machine Learning & Computational Methods** | Supervised/unsupervised/deep/reinforcement learning, learning theory, model selection, regularization, ensembles, transformers, probabilistic ML |
| 5 | **Causal Inference & Experimentation** | DAGs, potential outcomes, identification strategies (IV, RDD, DID, matching, synthetic control), A/B testing, sensitivity analysis |
| 6 | **Reproducibility & MLOps** | Version control, environment management, pipeline orchestration, experiment tracking, model deployment, monitoring |
| 7 | **Communication & Impact** | Scientific writing, visualization, uncertainty communication, stakeholder translation, peer review, grant writing |
| 8 | **Research Leadership** | Identifying novel research questions, literature synthesis, mentoring, cross-disciplinary collaboration, ethical conduct |

**Important:** This skill does not make the agent a domain expert in specific application fields (medicine, economics, biology, etc.). It provides the *statistical and methodological expertise* to collaborate with domain experts.

## Decision Framework

Before answering any data science question, classify it into one of these types. The classification determines the response structure and rigor required.

### Question Classifier

```
User asks a data question.
│
├─ "What model/technique should I use?"
│  → TYPE: ADVICE
│  → Respond with: options + tradeoffs + recommendation + what I'd need to know
│  → Mode: consultative, conditional recommendations
│
├─ "Is this result significant? / Analyze this data."
│  → TYPE: ANALYSIS
│  → Respond with: assumptions check → appropriate test → effect size → uncertainty → interpretation
│  → Mode: rigorous protocol, every step documented
│
├─ "Does X cause Y? / What drives Z?"
│  → TYPE: RESEARCH
│  → Respond with: causal framework → identification strategy → sensitivity → limitations
│  → Mode: causal language, no correlation claims without identification
│
├─ "How should I set up this experiment / study?"
│  → TYPE: DESIGN
│  → Respond with: design taxonomy → power analysis → blocking → randomization → analysis plan
│  → Mode: prescriptive, pre-registration-style
│
├─ "Review this analysis / paper / result."
│  → TYPE: REVIEW
│  → Respond with: methodology check → assumption audit → robustness → reproducibility → summary
│  → Mode: critical, constructive, specific
│
├─ "Compare these methods / Justify an approach."
│  → TYPE: METHODOLOGY
│  → Respond with: criteria → comparison table → recommendation with rationale
│  → Mode: structured, multi-dimensional evaluation
│
├─ "Run a research campaign / I need to find the best approach"
│  → TYPE: CAMPAIGN
│  → Respond with: load references/experimental-campaign-protocol.md
│  → Mode: pipeline orchestration, iterative, multi-experiment
│
├─ Unclear / exploratory
│  → TYPE: CLARIFY
│  → Respond with: ask about data type, question structure, available data, decision context
│  → Mode: investigative
```

### Response Rigor by Type

| Type | Must Include | Must Not Do |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| ADVICE | Tradeoffs, assumptions, when NOT to use | Give single answer without caveats |
| ANALYSIS | Assumption checks, effect sizes, CIs, diagnostics | Stop at p-value |
| RESEARCH | Identification strategy, sensitivity, causal framework | Claim causality from observational data without caveats |
| DESIGN | Power analysis, randomization scheme, sample size justification | Promise significance |
| REVIEW | Specific issues with evidence, reproducibility check | Vague criticism |
| METHODOLOGY | Criteria-based comparison, explicit rationale | Personal preference |

## Statistical Philosophy

### First Principle: Assumptions Before Methods

The most important question is never "which test do I use?" but _"what am I willing to assume about how these data were generated?"_ Every statistical method is a set of assumptions expressed as mathematics. Violate the assumptions and the method produces nonsense with high confidence.

Sequence: **Data generating process → assumptions → method selection → diagnostics → sensitivity → conclusion**

### Frequentist vs Bayesian Decision Rule

| Use Frequentist When | Use Bayesian When |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Well-established standard in your field | Prior information exists and should be used explicitly |
 | P-values are expected by your audience | You need probabilistic statements about parameters |
| You need a clear decision boundary | Small sample sizes with strong domain knowledge |
| The analysis must be fully specified upfront | Complex hierarchical models |
| Speed / simplicity matters | You want posterior uncertainty quantification |

**Never present only p-values.** Report effect sizes with confidence intervals (frequentist) or credible intervals (Bayesian) in every case.

### Replicability Stance

Assume your analysis will be audited by someone with your dataset and your code. What would they need to get the same results? If there's a researcher degrees-of-freedom choice (how to handle outliers, which covariates to include, which test to run), document the decision and justify it.

---

## Problem Formulation Protocol

When the user presents an ambiguous data science request, translate it through these steps before touching any method:

1. **What kind of data?** (numeric, categorical, time series, text, spatial, censored, hierarchical, high-dimensional)
2. **What kind of question?** (descriptive, predictive, causal, mechanistic, exploratory)
3. **What's the target?** (population parameter, future observation, treatment effect, latent structure)
4. **What's available?** (sample size, features, access to more data, computational constraints)
5. **What's at stake?** (consequential decisions, exploratory only, internal vs external audience)

Then map to a method using the framework above.

**Example:**
- User: "I ran an A/B test and want to know if the new design is better."
- Reformulated: "We have a binary outcome (conversion), two independent groups, a randomized assignment. Question: is there a difference in conversion rates, and if so, how large? Stake: product decision."
- Method: Two-proportion z-test with CI, or chi-square, or Bayesian beta-Binomial model if prior data exists.

## Core Principles

1. **Assumptions precede methods.** Never apply a method without checking whether its assumptions hold for your data. Every reference file in this skill includes assumption-checking guidance.

2. **Effect sizes over p-values.** Statistical significance tells you about sample size, not importance. Always report magnitude and precision (CI/CrI).

3. **Causal questions need causal methods.** If the question involves "effect of X on Y," you need identification strategy, not just regression. See `references/causal-inference-framework.md`.

4. **Diagnose before trust.** Every fitted model gets assumption diagnostics before interpretation. See `scripts/assumption-diagnostics.py`.

5. **Uncertainty is not optional.** Every estimate comes with uncertainty quantification. If you can't quantify uncertainty, say so and explain why.

6. **Design before data.** If you can influence data collection, do power analysis and randomization planning first. See `references/experimental-design.md` and `scripts/power-analysis.py`.

7. **Reproducibility is non-negotiable.** Code, data, environment, and random seeds must be documented. See `assets/experimental-plan-template.md`.

8. **The simplest defensible model wins.** Favor interpretability until complexity demonstrably improves predictions or inference. Justify complexity with evidence (cross-validation, model comparison, sensitivity analysis).

9. **Know your compute.** Before running any experiment, detect available hardware. The model architecture, batch size, and techniques you can use depend on available VRAM, CUDA, and RAM. See `scripts/detect-compute.py`. See `references/docker-experiment-isolation.md` for safe execution.

## Infrastructure Awareness

Before recommending or running any experiment, detect your compute environment. Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/detect-compute.py --minimal
```

This returns a JSON object that self-constrains what approaches are feasible:

- `model_size_tier: "cpu_only"` — no deep learning; use sklearn/xgboost/lightgbm
- `model_size_tier: "7B-13B"` — full fine-tuning or LoRA feasible on available VRAM
- `model_size_tier: "up_to_3B"` — QLoRA recommended, full FT for tiny models only

The agent should detect compute *before* selecting methods, not after failing. Integrate this check at the start of any CAMPAIGN task or before Phase 4 (Moonshot Experiments) in the campaign protocol.

## Communication Standards

### Structure for Analysis Reports

1. **Question & Context** — what was asked, what data available, what's at stake
2. **Methods** — what was done, with assumptions and justifications
3. **Results** — effect sizes with uncertainty, visuals with proper encoding
4. **Diagnostics** — assumption checks, robustness checks
5. **Limitations** — what was assumed, what could go wrong, what can't be concluded
6. **Conclusion** — answer the original question, with appropriate hedging

### Uncertainty Communication

- **Continuous estimates:** report point estimate ± uncertainty with interval type clearly stated (95% CI, 95% CrI, ±2 SE)
- **Categorical decisions:** use phrases like "the data are consistent with X, but do not rule out Y"
- **Visual:** show distributions, not just point estimates. Error bars must be labeled (SD, SE, CI — these are not interchangeable)
- **Never say "prove"** or "disprove." Use "support," "are consistent with," "provide evidence for/against"

### Visual Best Practices

- Label axes clearly with units
- Show uncertainty (error bars, bands, credible intervals)
- Use color only to encode data, not decoration
- Prefer violin/box plots over bar charts for distributions
- Always include a caption describing what the reader should see
